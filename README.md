## ✨ What is Warmtail?

**Warmtail** is a cozy top-down puzzle-adventure set in a gentle underwater world
slowly freezing to death.

You play as a small axolotl — a fragment of a fallen star —
able to **share warmth**, melt ice, and heal both the world and its inhabitants.

There is no rush.  
No punishment for kindness.  
Only exploration, care, and quiet discovery.

## 🧩 Core Experience

🌊 **Explore** a layered underwater world — from warm depths to frozen upper seas  
🔥 **Share warmth** to revive creatures, unlock paths, and solve puzzles  
🧠 **Think, not rush** — puzzles reward curiosity, not reflexes  
🏠 **Return home** — decorate your space and invite characters you’ve helped  
💬 **Listen** — every NPC has a story, and warmth changes how they tell it

## 🎮 Gameplay Loop

**Explore → Warm → Connect → Discover**

Dive into caves.  
Break ice with a heat dash.  
Warm a frozen creature.  
Hear their story.  
Bring a piece of the world back home.

Each action makes the ocean a little warmer.

## 💛 Atmosphere \& Themes

Warmtail is a game about:

* kindness without reward
* warmth as a shared resource
